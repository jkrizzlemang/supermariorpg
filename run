t the hidden room
behind the crates to get a Frog Coin. Then retreat a room and go down the
stairs to a room with two chests and a save point. Save first, and then get the
near chest to find a healing Mushroom. The farther chest contains Hidon, a fake
treasure chest enemy. Be sure you have the Amulet equipped.

Optional Boss 3 - Hidon

Mario strategy - Jump tears Hidon to shreds. Super Jump can work too if you are
in that sort of a mood. Use Jump to take out all the Goombettes once Hidon is
gone. This is the sort of easy fight that everybody loves.

Mallow strategy - Okay, for this fight to be possible, you're going to need an
Energizer and the Rock Candy from Booster Pass. It's a really good thing that
the save point is so close too since this also will take a good amount of luck.
Start the fight with the Energizer, and then use the Rock Candy twice. Yes, you
absolutely have to get a freebie on the Rock Candy, or you can forget about
winning this fight. Actually, a Rock Candy is worth more than the 17 EXP, 100
coins, and Safety Badge that you get for winning this fight. Unless you are
dedicated to trying over and over again until you get the freebie twice, you
can forget this fight. Of course, if you do get the freebie twice, that's
always cool. You are right next to the save point, and the battle is only three
turns long. It's not too bad to just try over and over again until luck is on
your side.

Geno strategy - Start the battle with Geno Boost, and then lay into Hidon with
Geno Beam. Ignore his minions and just hammer away at him. He only has 600 HP
so it should not take too long. Geno Beam will also be the method of choice to
wipe out the Goomettes once he is gone.

Bowser strategy - You are going to think I'm joking, but I'm not. Hidon
counters physicals with either his physical attack or the very dangerous Carni
Kiss. Physical attacks are out of the question. However, you do have one way to
cause magic damage to him. Yes, that's right. You are going to use Terrorize
over and over again until Hidon falls. It seems fantastically stupid, but it
works. If any Goombettes remain after Hidon falls, some good old fashioned
Bowser physicals will make quick work of them. You'll likely use quite a few
Mid Mushrooms during this fight, and you will probably need a Maple Syrup as
well.

Toadstool strategy - Follow Mallow's strategy to the letter, but I'm really
going to stress this with Toadstool. The Rock Candy is worth more than winning
this fight. Do not lose the Rock Candy; only accept a fight in which you get
two freebies. Toadstool needs item attacks more than the other characters; you
don't want to lose the best item attack that easily.

If you have to restock on some items, now would be a good time to head back to
the merchant and buy up. The chest which used to contain Hidon will have 100
coins when you return so you can make back all your shopping money really
easily. Once you're finished with this whole ordeal, proceed through the door
past Hidon, and then immediately run through the next door. This dungeon's end
is in sight!

In this room, jump into the whirlpool to head underwater, and then go back to
the previous room via the underwater door to get quite a few frog coins. Then
proceed onward to a submerged staircase teeming with enemies. Fight your way
through if you wish, and then you'll be in a very large, water filled room.
Behind the barrels in the northwestern corner is a secret room containing the
Safety Ring. The Safety Ring is the single most important accessory in this
challenge. I can't stress it enough. GET THE SAFETY RING. You will probably not
be finishing the game if you don't get it, and it's a long trip back here if
you forget it. The Safety Ring gives the same stat bonuses as the Fearless Pin
except it also gives +5 to speed. It nullifies all status ailments. Yes, it
just rendered all other status protection items obsolete, including that Safety
Badge that you just got. It also makes you immune to instant death, and it
grants immunity to a wide variety of enemy specials as well. It certainly does
not protect you from all enemy specials or even most of them, but it does
protect you from quite a few of them. Really, this item is completely awesome.

After you're finished getting the Safety Ring, proceed up the barrels to the
surface of the water. Cross the water to the southwest corner of the room to
find a frog coin, and then exit the room via the door near where you surfaced.
You'll be confronted by a group of four Bandana Reds. These are not very strong
enemies. Magic tears them apart, especially Mallow's Thunderbolt. All status
effects work on them as well so Toadstool can use Sleepy Time to help herself
out a bit, and Bowser gets to play with Terrorize. Once they are fallen, you
will see a chest you could grab. Do not grab it. Make sure you are at full
health and run up the stairs to see the single best line in the game:

WHAT THE? How dare you dodge the barrel!

Seriously, that's brilliant. I hope whoever wrote that line got a promotion for
it. Anyway, continuing up the staircase will end with you engaged in fisticuffs
with five Bandana Reds. Fighting five of them is not much different from
fighting four of them so just flatten them. Afterward, they will open the door
behind them to Johnny's room. Johnny is the boss; don't rush in.

If you are going to run back to the save point near Hidon, do so before
grabbing that chest. Either way, before you go into Johnny's room, open the
chest to get a healing Mushroom. Full HP and FP is helpful in a boss fight. You
will want to concern yourself with your level and equipment. I was at level 12
for the Johnny fight, but level 11 works for the most part. If you are doing
Toadstool's challenge, you will really want to be at level 12. The fight is a
whole lot longer at level 11 since you have 7 less attack, and you are doing
very little damage to Johnny anyway. As per equipment, everyone should equip
the Amulet. In order to speed up the fight, Toadstool should also equip the
Work Pants. If you were a FOOL and sold the Work Pants, the fight is just going
to be that much longer.

Boss 12- Jonathan "Johnny" Jones

Note: Clever people will try to kill all of the Bandana Blues after Mario dies
to prevent the 1v1 fight. They'll be punished by Johnny using more powerful
attacks. It doesn't matter if Mario is alive or not; do not, under any
circumstances, kill all four Bandana Blues.

Mario strategy - Use Jump to take out three of the Bandana Blues and then focus
on Johnny. You can use Super Jump over Jump against Johnny if you want; it
really does not matter. Just be sure to leave the last Bandana Blue standing.
This will prevent Johnny from using any attack other than his physical, and it
will prevent the 1v1 fight. You might be wondering why the 1v1 fight is so bad,
but I have to inform you that Johnny becomes an entirely different monster.
Notably, he gains elemental immunities to jump and fire. Of course, he also
uses many of the more powerful techniques that Johnny ordinarily uses if you
kill all of his minions. Really, the whole ordeal is just that much easier if
you leave a Bandana Blue alive. Actually, it's really easy. I doubt you'll need
more than one Mid Mushroom.

Mallow strategy - This fight is all about Shocker. Start by roasting three of
the Bandana Blues with Shocker, and then set into Johnny with Shocker. You will
definitely want to spare one of the Bandana Blues; this keeps Johnny stuck
using just his physical attack, and it prevents the 1v1 fight with Mario. You
will probably have to heal a few times with HP Rain and use a few Maple Syrups,
but Johnny should go down pretty easily.

Geno strategy - As always, open the fight with Geno Boost. The Bandana Blues
are just stronger versions of the Bandana Reds; Geno Beam will easily take them
out. Be absolutely sure to leave one of them alive; this prevents the 1v1 fight
with Mario from triggering and also limits what moves Johnny will use. After
he's down to one ally, just hammer Johnny with Geno Beam. Be sure to use Mid
Mushrooms to heal if you need them, and use Max Mushrooms if you have to (try
to avoid it). This should not be very hard.

Bowser strategy - Open up with Terrorize to inflict fear upon the Bandana Blues
and then take out three of them with your physical attacks. Don't kill the last
one as this keeps Johnny just using his physical attack, and it absolutely
prevents the 1v1 fight with Mario from triggering. Once three of the Bandana
Blues are dead, just lay into Johnny with physicals. He has good physical
defense, but you have Bowser level attacks. Since the only attacks you will see
in this fight are physicals, Bowser should do quite well. Heal with a Mid
Mushroom if you have a problem. Note that Johnny himself can be inflicted with
fear so feel free to use Terrorize a second time to speed up the fight.
However, do not use it a third time as this carries a high risk of killing the
last Bandana Blue. This should not be very difficult at all; just follow this
strategy, and it should be easy.

Toadstool strategy - If you have a Bad Mushroom, start the fight by using it on 
Johnny. Otherwise or afterward, open with an Energizer, and then take out three
of the Bandana Blues with your physical attack. Then start on Johnny with the
same plan. This will take a very long time, and you will have to heal with
Therapy quite a few times. Still, Johnny has no real ability to threaten you,
and if you equipped yourself exactly as I told you to and further are at level
12 (or higher, of course), this should not take an unbearably long time. Also,
the Bandana Blues can be put to sleep with Sleepy Time. You certainly don't
have to do it, but you can open the fight with Sleepy Time if you want. It
might make the start a bit easier. The Work Pants hurt your defense a lot, and
the Bandana Blues ganging up on you can make life hard. Using a Bracer or a
Yoshi-Ade can also help if the start of the fight is too rough.

You get a boatload of experience points for defeating Johnny, and then you get
the precious Star Piece. That was very much so hard earned, but you're not
finished earning it yet. Use the trampoline in the next room and return to
Seaside Town.

Now here our good friend the elder reveals himself to be Yaridovich, a member
of the Smithy gang. Gee, I never would have guessed. As strange as it is, you
should agree to hand over the Star Piece the first time he asks. This gets you
a Flower Box later. He'll take off, and you should make tracks for the inn and
save. You'll want to equip the Safety Ring with most characters, but Toadstool
really needs the +7 attack from the Amulet. Toadstool would really like the +10
attack from the Work Pants as well, but you won't survive this fight unless you
equip the Nautica Dress. Yeah, this is going to be long. Yes, this is the real
boss you have to defeat to earn this Star Piece; he's easily the hardest boss
you'll have fought so far. Be sure you are well stocked on items; you will have
to use more Mushrooms with the non-healers than you have had to use in the
past. Also, everyone except Geno will want either a Bracer or a Yoshi-Ade.
Toadstool will need an Energizer as well if she does not have the Yoshi-Ade.

Boss 13 - Yaridovich

Mario strategy - Open up with a Bracer, and then get to giving Yaridovich a
healthy beating via Jump or Super Jump. Yaridovich has the potential to do some
serious damage to Mario, but Mario's offensive insanity should manage to beat
Yaridovich down fairly effectively. Don't switch targets after the mirage; that
ensures that you always target the real thing. Just be sure to not take any
stupid chances when it comes to healing; this should end well.

Mallow strategy - Start things off with a Bracer, and then start hammering
Yaridovich with Shocker. Yaridovich is weak to thunder, and Mallow is the
perfect character to exploit that. Yaridovich still has decent magic defense so
it will take a while, but that thunder weakness really does help Mallow out a
lot. You'll also need to heal a good amount with HP Rain, and you'll probably
have to use some Maple Syrup to keep up your spell spamming during this fight.
Just keep at it and keep healed, and Yaridovich should fall easily enough.
Do remember to not switch targets after he summons the mirage; it would be a
terrible waste to use Shocker on the false Yaridovich.

Geno strategy - Open with Geno Boost, and then begin to lay into Yaridovich
with physicals. Heal with Mid Mushrooms or Max Mushrooms when your health gets
low; this will likely happen quite a few times. Yaridovich has 1500 HP, and he
can summon a mirage. Your cursor automatically targets the real Yaridovich so
you can just focus on him the whole time without confusion. The Safety Ring
will protect you from Flame Stone and some of the spells the mirage uses, but
it won't protect you from his signature move, Water Blast. The fight will be
long and arduous (compared to everything else so far), but you should be able
to win.

Bowser strategy - Start the fight with a Bracer, and then simply use physical
attacks. Yaridovich is immune to fear so Terrorize is not any help at all in
this fight. You'll likely need to heal quite a bit with Mid and Max Mushrooms;
Bowser's poor magic defense is really highlighted during this fight.
Yaridovich's 85 defense and 1500 HP will make this quite long. You
automatically target the real Yaridovich after he summons his mirage; don't
foolishly switch targets. The good news is that Yaridovich does not have a
whole lot of FP; your ability to repeatedly attack rises greatly once he runs
out. Just keep at it, and this fight shouldn't be too bad. It's the hardest so
far, but it's quite manageable.

Toadstool strategy - Okay, everyone else has a very short fight in comparison
with what Toadstool has to endure. Start the fight with either a Yoshi-Ade or
a Bracer -> Energizer combo. Then use your physical until Yaridovich falls.
That sounds nice and simple, but the damage you do will be very sad. Therapy
again ensures that you are not likely to die; it's just a war of attrition.
Luckily, Yaridovich's poor FP will kick in, and his ability to damage you will
decline greatly one he runs out. You can use attacking items to speed this up
if you have them to spare, but Yaridovich's 1500 HP means that it will largely
come down to a very slow physical attack spam fest. Have fun, and remember not
to switch targets when the mirage appears. You automatically target the real
one.

Now you have the fifth Star Piece for real. Yes, you certainly did earn it, and
you also have earned the right to explore the real town. Take the key and
unlock the previously guarded door to free the townspeople. The elder will be
so kind as to give you a Flower Box since you didn't let him get tortured. Of
course, if you refused to give up the Star Piece, you will have a lesser
reward. Now let's explore the various shops.

The first shop on the left is Beetles R Us. Here you can invest 150 coins for
access to the beetle races. The beetle races are a great way to harvest
ordinary coins; in my opinion, it's the best way. You likely have 999 coins
right now so you should make the investment now. Later on, if you need some
cash, this will pay off.

The second and third doors lead to the weapon and armor shops. The armor shop
just sells old stuff, but you can get some new weapons at the weapon shop. Buy
the new weapons for everyone who has something except Mario. Mario's weapon
here isn't any stronger than the Masher. However, it is less random. I prefer
the Masher so I wouldn't waste the coins, but if you really dislike how random
the Masher is, it's fine to get this otherwise forgettable shell.

The fourth door is a "health food store" that just sells some basic healing
items. It's a good place to restock if Yaridovich drained you, but otherwise
it's nothing special.

The fifth door leads you to Mushroom Boy. You can give him regular Mushrooms,
and he'll randomly give you nothing, a Maple Syrup, a Rock Candy, or a Flower
Tab. I tend to find him way too annoying and random to deal with, but you
could, in theory, get 99 FP right now or stock up on Rock Candies. It's up to
you whether to mess with him or not.

The sixth door leads to an accessory shop. They sell the various status
protection pins that are outdated by the Safety Ring as well as Zoom Shoes
which you already have. You can forget this place for the most part.

Once you're finished with your shopping, you need to talk to the elder. He'll
direct you toward Land's End which is going to be your next dungeon.

Also, if you are doing Mario, Geno, or Bowser's challenges, you very likely are
going to be looking to replace some Mushrooms. Your HP is starting to get too
high to really rely on Mid Mushrooms; go the extra mile and harvest Max
Mushrooms from Star Hill. Mid Mushrooms are still useful, and you should still
carry a few, but begin the transition toward using mostly Max Mushrooms. It
will make things easier for you in the long run. Also, on that note, you would
be well advised to make sure you have a few Bracers or Yoshi-Ades. They will
be useful in the future, and there's no time to collect them like the present!

Well, with all that business taken care of, let's head over to our next
dungeon, Land's End.
