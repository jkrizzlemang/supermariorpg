Okay, this place is intense. The enemies are strong, and it ends with two very
strong bosses. The good news is that near the end there's a shop that sells the
excellent fire armor as well as an inn. You don't have to worry about keeping
in good health for the bosses.

Enemies:

Magmus - Magic is the best way to deal with him. Do watch out as he's immune to
jump and all status effects so Mario, Bowser, and Toadstool do have to stick to
boring physical plans.
Armored Ant - Don't leave him for last or else he'll use Vigor Up!. Magic is
the way to go with him, and that includes a nice Terrorize from Bowser. Fear
not only weakens him and hits his low magic defense, but it can negate Vigor
Up!.
Oerlikon - He's very similar to Magmus. He's immune to jump and status, but
he has poor magic defense.
Chained Kong - Mario can use his magic, but everyone else should stick to the
physicals here. His magic defense is worse and he is status weak so including
him in a group Snowy, Geno Blast, or Terrorize isn't a bad idea.
Vomer - It's just Dry Bones version two. Use any magic to quickly and easily
destroy him.
Pyrosphere - Mario and Mallow should definitely use magic to take him down.
Geno, Bowser, and Toadstool should stick to physicals, but he is weak so
catching him as a part of a group with Geno Blast isn't a bad idea.
Stumpet - Hit him hard and fast with magic. Sadly, he is immune to fear and
sleep so Bowser and Toadstool are very likely to see his powerful attacks that
he uses every other turn.
Corkpedite - Kill the Body and ignore it. Sand Storm is quite nasty as always.
Body - It has a magic defense stat of one. Even Bowser should join in the magic
assault with Crusher. However, if you have instant death protection equipped,
it can't hurt you so you don't have to worry about ignoring it. Toadstool
should flee from these battles if she doesn't have instant death protection.

You will want to reach level 17 by the end of this dungeon. In terms of
accessories, there are a lot of choices. Almost everything here is weak to ice
and magic in general so Mallow should definitely go with the Scrooge Ring so he
can abuse Snowy to its fullest extent. Bowser has the easy choice of the Jinx
Belt. It protects him from instant death and massively boosts the stats that
are important to him. If you don't have the Jinx Belt, you're in somewhat of a
bind and will be stuck between the Troopa Pin and Safety Ring, neither of which
are nearly as useful here. Mario has two real options. He can use the Jinx Belt
for the big defense buff and instant death protection and rely on having over
200 attack to be his big thing in here. He could also equip the Jump Shoes to
try to exploit Jump, but the Jump Shoes leave him defensively vulnerable. Geno
has a similar double choice. He can use the Jinx Belt and use his physical
nearly exclusively here, or he can use the Scrooge Ring and rely mostly on Geno
Blast. The former option is safer, but the latter is faster. Toadstool doesn't
have options that are nearly as lucrative as everyone else's choices. She can
use the Safety Ring to really help her against Pyrosphere and Corkpedite/Body,
or she can use the Troopa Pin for speedier kills. The Troopa Pin will help her
a lot, but her fight with Corkpedite/Body is awful without the Safety Ring.
It's really up to you what you prefer or whether you're willing to juggle
accessories based on what enemies you expect to be fighting.

Regardless of how you choose to fight your battles, this place is extremely
linear. Unless you jump down from an elevated place, you never have multiple
choices about which way to go. I'll point out a few rooms of interest, but for
the most part, I'll leave navigating this place up to you. You do get a lot of
Flowers here; I will assume that you will hit 99 FP here if you didn't already.

The first room of mild interest is a room with a frog coin over the lava. The
frog coin is well obtainable; you just have to leap out to get it. No, there
are no negative consequences for doing this regardless of how foolish it seems.

The next interesting room is the room with a seemingly unreachable frog coin
above a doorway. The trick is to run through the room, exit through that
doorway, return, and then leap into the lava. Mario's third degree burns are a
minor concern; you just got a frog coin!

The next screen of interest is a place with a chest and a man standing in a
doorway. Ignore the chest for now as it just contains coins, and you likely
have maxed out money. The man is Hinopio, and he'll lead you into his store. Be
sure to buy some fire armor unless you are doing Bowser's challenge, and also
be sure to heal up at the inn. Head back and get the chest after you do your
shopping, and then progress onward out of Hinopio Mart and save. You are very
close to the Czar Dragon, the first of the two nasty bosses here in the Barrel
Volcano.

You'll want to equip yourself for this boss fight. The boss is able to inflict
fear, but he doesn't do it very often. You also have the double problem of
having to deal with the Helios he summons. Basically, it works like this. The
Czar Dragon sometimes randomly summons four Helio monsters. As soon as these
get a turn, they will immediately suicide on you with a decently strong
unblockable physical. Therefore, it is greatly to your advantage to go between
the Czar Dragon and the Helios. The Czar Dragon has 20 speed, and the Helios
have 0 speed. Every character has to look at this problem differently.

Mario is in a tough spot. In the case of a tie in speed, he is guaranteed to
go before the Czar Dragon since Toadstool's 24 speed is the fastest in the
battle and thereby gives your party the win in all tiebreak situations. Yeah, I
don't like it either. He can use the Amulet to reduce his speed to 15, but then
he's open to being inflicted with fear. He could equip the Safety Ring to block
the fear, as well as Flame Wall, but then he's guaranteed to have to take the
4 hits from the Helios. The choice is really yours here; both paths have their
advantages and disadvantages. Mario is so powerful that the battle will not
last very long, especially if he opens it with a Yoshi-Ade instead of a Bracer.
Do note that two bits of luck are needed with the Amulet path. First of all,
you need the good luck of not being inflicted with fear immediately before the
Czar Dragon summons Helios. Secondly, you need to get lucky with Ultra Jump and
hit all four Helios with it. I will be using the Safety Ring for my strategies
since it also helps slightly in the Zombone section of the fight. However, if
you are willing to reset for some good luck, you could save some very precious
Max Mushrooms by using the Amulet instead.

Mallow has a bit of an easier choice. His base 18 speed is slow enough that he
doesn't have to worry about outspeeding the Czar Dragon unless he equips the
Safety Ring or another speed boosting item. He can easily wipe out all of the
Helios and punish the Czar Dragon's ice weakness with Snowy. Of course, if the
Safety Ring doesn't work, just use the Safety Badge! You lose the protection
from Flame Wall, but you keep the more important fear protection and retain
your slower speed. Of course, if you've been following this guide, you very
likely do not have the Safety Badge. In that case, the Fearless Pin works as a
fine substitute.

Geno has an easy choice, but it's not the sort of choice that you want to be
that simple. Geno's base 30 speed will outspeed the Czar Dragon no matter what
you equip (remembering that the Lazy Shell armor is banned). Therefore, you
should just equip the Safety Ring and hope for the best. You do have the option
of using the Jinx Belt and using the nice stat gains from it to try to win in
fewer turns while using luck and Able Juice to get around fear. I'll be using
the Safety Ring for my strategies, but do be aware of the other choice.

Bowser is, for once, quite happy that he's the slowest character in the game.
Additionally, his standard two allies, Mario and Mallow, are slow enough so
that if Bowser were to have 20 speed that he would still go after the Czar
Dragon. This means that you're allowed to equip an item which boosts your speed
by 5. You have two choices. You could stick with your Work Pants as your armor
and use the Safety Badge. The other choice is to buy a Flame Shell form Hinopio
and then equip the Safety Ring. The former option gives you more attack, and
the latter option is somewhat better defensively. I'll be using the first
option for my strategies, but the second one is really just about as valid.

Toadstool is slightly faster than the Czar Dragon to start. She can equip the
Amulet to go second, but any form of fear protection makes her go first. She
also has another serious problem. If you've been following this guide, you
will only be at level 17. Toadstool doesn't learn Psych Bomb, her only
offensive special to strike all enemies, until level 18. Unless you level up to
level 18, you will have to rely on item attacks. Here things get even worse.
The Helios are immune to fire so Fire Bombs will do nothing. Rock Candies are
also mostly out of the question. Remember that you absolutely need to have two
Rock Candies for the next boss, the Axem Rangers. Even if you have more, they
are so useful that it would be somewhat wasteful to use them here. That really
just leaves Ice Bombs. If you have quite a few spare Ice Bombs, feel free to
rely on them and use the Amulet. If not, just use the Safety Ring. You can
stall nearly infinitely with Therapy, and with the Yoshi-Ade effects, you
aren't going to be wiped out in one turn. The Safety Ring is indeed the safe
option here; the fight is actually pretty easy with the Safety Ring. Just be
aware that you have other options.

If you are not using fear protection in this fight, be sure to go and buy some
Able Juice from Hinopio. They cost nearly nothing at this point in the game,
but you might not have much room in your inventory for them. Still, having a
few will likely help you out. Muku Cookies obviously work as substitutes if you
want to do that. Regardless of what you have done, press boldly ahead and
prepare to meet this game's token dragon.

Boss 18 - Czar Dragon

Note: The Czar Dragon summons Helios after using his physical attack (using it
as a counter, which he does 1/3 of the time, does not count) or after using
Iron Maiden. He won't summon them after using a spell.

Mario strategy - Opening this fight with a Yoshi-Ade saves precious turns, but
it's winnable with just a Bracer if you really don't want to use a Yoshi-Ade
for some reason. The plan is to just go all out with Jump (or Super Jump/Ultra
Jump). You do some pretty massive damage to both the Czar Dragon and Zombone
with this sort of attack; they won't last too long. You just need to hope for
luck. You need to hope that the Czar Dragon does not summon Helios very often,
and you need to hope that Zombone doesn't use Blast and Storm as often as his
weak, easily blockable physical. The whole point is to use as few Max Mushrooms
as possible since there's another boss fight right after this. If you are using
the Amulet instead of the Safety Ring, be sure to use Ultra Jump against the
summoned Helios, and be sure to cure fear whenever you get a chance. Good luck
as you will need some luck here!

Mallow strategy - On my test file, I beat this fight using a Kerokerocola and
no other items. At the start of the fight, it would be very helpful to use a
Bracer, Energizer, or Yoshi-Ade, but you really don't need it. The Czar Dragon
is weak to ice, and Snowy will also wipe out all of the Helios. Use Snowy
whenever he summons Helios, and if you manage to get a totally free turn, use
your physical (that's not very likely). Once Zombone comes out, go all out on
healing with some physicals mixed in. Zombone is pretty powerful, but he isn't
capable of wiping you out in one turn, and he has very limited FP. Once he runs
out of FP, you can get more aggressive with your physical. He has pretty
horrible defense so he should go down fairly easily.

Geno strategy - Open the fight with Geno Boost and then go all out with
physical attacks. Unfortunately, you can't really do anything at all about the
Helios so just take the hits and heal more often because of the threat. The
Czar Dragon won't last too long, but when he falls you get the treat of the
second stage of your first true multi-form boss. Zombone is much more powerful
than the Czar Dragon, but you have some advantages. Zombone never summons
Helios, and his physical defense is actually a good deal worse. Also, if you
have any Pure Water, it would be a decent idea to use them on Zombone. He won't
instantly die, but he will attack himself for decent damage. Pure Water are
ordinarily totally useless so this is quite an improvement. Really, if you can
make it to the Zombone section of the fight, you have pretty much won. This
isn't even a hard boss at all really, but you need to worry about how many Max
Mushrooms you use, unless you feel like going all the way back to Star Hill and
then returning here before the next boss.

Bowser strategy - This is a pretty cool fight for Bowser no matter how you look
at it. Open things up with a Bracer or Yoshi-Ade (the latter is preferred in
order to save Max Mushroooms), use Terrorize to inflict fear on the Czar
Dragon if you only boosted one stat, and then move in with physical attacks. If
the Czar Dragon summons his Helios, use Terrorize to eliminate them and to
renew the fear on the Czar Dragon. Eventually, the Czar Dragon will fall, and
Zombone will take his place. Zombone is immune to fear, but he doesn't summon
Helios either. Zombone also has much worse physical defense than the Czar
Dragon. A continued barrage of physical attacks should bring him down fairly
easily, though you can feel free to use any spare Pure Water you have to do a
good amount of damage on the side. All around, this is a mostly easy but not
totally easy fight so it's just entertaining.

Toadstool strategy - This fight is all about Mute. No, I'm not kidding, and I
will never say this about any other fight for the rest of the game. The Czar
Dragon and Zombone both are able to be inflicted with Mute, and it really
messes both of them up. In the Czar Dragon's case, it blocks Flame Wall and
Water Blast. The latter was actually fairly dangerous. Against Zombone, it just
destroys him. Mute blocks Boulder, Blast, and Storm which is also the full list
of all of Zombone's dangerous attacks. With all that being said, the strategy
is simple. Open with a Yoshi-Ade or a Bracer -> Energizer combo and then use
your physical to take the boss down. Be sure to keep the mute status inflicted
the whole match, and be sure to keep healed with Therapy. Once the fight
progresses to the Zombone stage, you have practically won. His only real way of
hurting you is gone, and Zombone has considerably less defense than the Czar
Dragon. It's amazing, but for once, Toadstool has perhaps the easiest time of
all the characters.

After you have slain the dragon, run ahead to get the sixth Star Piece. You
have it for all of a millisecond until it is stolen by the Axem Rangers. Oh no!
They take off, and you can pursue them. Now, you very likely (and very
intelligently) are worrying about saving. You don't get stuck pursuing the Axem
Rangers so feel free to chase them a little further. That way, if you lose the
fight a few times, you will have to watch fewer scenes. I personally suggest
turning back after Yellow catches the Star Piece and informs Red that he
dropped it. Do be sure to save before taking the trampoline; you don't want to
redo the Czar Dragon. Also, check your items and equipment. There are two ways
to win this fight. You can win by "fighting hard", or you can win by using two
Rock Candies. Mallow and Toadstool cannot win no matter how hard they fight;
they will need the two Rock Candies. If you do not have them, you have
obviously not been taking my advice very seriously up to this point. You must
go back to Seaside Town and abuse Mushroom Boy until he gives you two Rock
Candies. You should just be thankful that you didn't totally prevent yourself
from completing the challenge. If you want to fight hard with Mario, Geno, or
Bowser, you'll need quite a few Max Mushrooms. Mario and Bowser will also want
a Yoshi-Ade. Do not use Bracers and Energizers as substitutes. Hopefully, you
will have everything you need without needing to leave the Barrel Volcano. It's
possible that you either didn't prepare well or had to use too many resources
against the Czar Dragon. If that's the case, you'll just have to leave and
return. In terms of equipment, you'll want to give Mario, Geno, and Bowser the
Jinx Belt. Mallow and Toadstool should equip the Troopa Pin. Anyone can use
Mallow and Toadstool's strategy so if you find this fight too hard with the
other characters, feel free to adapt. Eventually, you'll take the trampoline to
the top of the Barrel Volcano and be greeted with the most dangerous boss fight
this side of Culex.

Boss 19 - Axem Rangers

Mario strategy - Open with a Yoshi-Ade, and then take out Pink with physicals.
Green is your next target with the awesome power of the Lazy Shell and Jinx
Belt combination. This will prompt Red to use Vigor Up!, but the offensive
abilities of the Axem Rangers are quickly crumbling regardless. A single Jump
will be enough to take out Yellow; he is weak to jump. The next target is that
super powered Red. Physicals will dispatch him fairly quickly, and yes I know
how awkward it is not relying on Jump for once. This leaves you in a very
simple 1v1 with Black. Be sure to be in good health before defeating Black as
the Breaker Beam is able to kill you if your health is bad going into that
section of the fight. As per actually defeating Black, a physical attack
followed up by Jump should do it. If you're scared that the Jump won't kill and
absolutely do not want to see Spritz Bomb as a counter, just use physicals to
take out Black. The Breaker Beam section of the fight is really easy. You only
get attacked every other turn after all. It should only take 3-4 physical
attacks to seize victory at this point. You will need to use a few Max
Mushrooms in this fight, probably more than you have had to in any other fight.
Still, this is Mario's challenge. You are offensively insanely overpowered.
This fight should be winnable without too much trouble, though if you are bad
at timed defense and get bad luck in which spells Green uses early on, this
could get a bit more complicated.

Mallow strategy - The Troopa Pin ensures that you go first, and it gives you
the effect of an Energizer immediately. This is a battle against time more than
anything so you really need that boost. Open the fight with a Rock Candy, and
then the Axem Rangers will begin their assault. It is very possible that you
will die before your next turn, and if you do, I hope you saved. There's
another factor to consider here as well. Pink might heal someone. If she heals
Red, it's no big deal. However, if she heals anyone else, they are going to be
a part of this fight for even longer. Well, regardless of what happens and
totally regardless of your health, use another Rock Candy next turn. If Pink
either healed no one or healed Red, this will kill every ranger except Red. If
she healed someone, that person as well as Red will live while the other three
will die. Red will always use this turn to use Vigor Up! so you don't have to
worry about being attacked by him. If Pink survived, she'll use Petal Blast
which you can only pray misses. If it hits, it will probably kill you. If you
survive it, you'll be turned into a mushroom and will probably die before you
get another turn. If Black survived, he'll probably kill you, but you might get
lucky and/or manage to do some timed defense. Yellow and Green aren't as big of
threats if they survived, but both could hurt you really badly if things go
badly. Green could also mute you which could be really devastating. He's not
very likely to mute you at all, but it's possible. Anyway, after you heal as
needed, use a Bracer and then focus on any surviving Axem Rangers that are not
Red. Black will die from a single blast of Shocker. Pink and Green go down to
physicals. If Yellow is the ranger left, just start blasting with Snowy. It
will nail Red's ice weakness while simultaneously preventing Yellow's dangerous
Body Slam counter. If you have the good fortune of being locked in a 1v1 with
Red from the start (or after you've killed the other rangers), just take him
out with a few physicals. Be sure you are in good health before finishing Red.

Once all five rangers are dead, you have pretty much won. The second stage of
the fight is childishly easy. The Breaker Beam will fire every other turn for
high but not unbearable damage (if you are not under the effects of a Bracer,
it will probably kill you immediately). After 6 shots, it will be out of FP and
will do nothing until you destroy it. Shocker kills it faster, but it doesn't
matter much. If you are having trouble surviving, just alternate between
physical attacking and healing until it is out of FP. If you didn't notice,
this is a very random fight, and the damage output in the first stage of the
fight is far above what Mallow can ordinarily take even with a Bracer. However,
it might be possible to win with less cheesy tactics. I have tried quite hard
to win this fight in a Mallow solo on other files using different strategies,
and the only thing I was able to do to win other than this was abuse Red
Essence which is a banned item for a very good reason. If you want to try to
win this fight by fighting normally, I suggest equipping the Rare Scarf and
hoping for quite a bit of early luck. You'll need to use a Yoshi-Ade first
turn, you'll need to kill Pink first so you never see Petal Blast, you'll need
Black to play nice in general, and you'll need Green to never use Elegy. Note
that you can do massive damage to Black with Shocker (kills in two hits), but
he counters specials with Spritz Bomb which is almost certainly your ticket to
a Game Over so only hit him with Shocker if you are sure it will kill. Also,
Yellow counters physicals with Body Slam. Never, ever attack Yellow with a
physical attack. I think you also might have a shot if you used the Safety Ring
to block mushroomification and to negate most of what Green can do (pray you
don't see much of Meteor Blast) and then tried to take out Black fast. Ugh, I'm
actually fairly sure that it's possible to win this fight without the Rock
Candies as Mallow, but you'll need to get really lucky and have some really
good timing with the timed defense. Only try it if you're feeling quite
hardcore.

Geno strategy - Open with Geno Boost, and then set into Pink with physicals.
Pink must go first as Petal Blast, which she uses if one of her allies dies,
would lead you to the Game Over screen very quickly. After that, take out
Green with physicals as well. The Jinx Belt will do a really fantastic job of
reducing the damage that Black, Red, and Yellow do to a manageable level so
taking out the two casters is a big deal. Unfortunately, the death of two of
his allies triggers Red to use Vigor Up!. You can handle this fairly well.
Go after Black with physicals here; he won't last too long. With Black gone,
your group specials won't be countered by Spritz Bomb so you can use Geno Blast
or Geno Flash. At level 17 with rotation level up bonuses, Geno Flash is the
better choice here. Yellow has 600 HP, and Geno Flash does over 150 damage
which Geno Blast does not. This is the only stage of this fight in which you
need FP so don't be stingy. Use Geno Flash to take out Yellow and do some
decent damage to Red. Once Yellow is gone, finish off Red with physicals. Make
sure that you have decent health when Red dies as it will trigger the Breaker
Beam portion of the fight. This isn't a very hard section of the fight at all,
but it's possible to lose if you get careless. The Breaker Beam can only fire 6
times before running out of FP, but it won't last that long. This fight as a
whole is very likely to drain a rather unfortunate number of Max Mushrooms.
Don't worry about it; you have them to use them. There is not a time in the
future for which they would be better saved. Fight your best, and you should be
able to win this.

Bowser strategy - His fight with the Axem Rangers is fairly similar to Geno's
version. It will probably be slightly easier. You have to open the fight with
a Yoshi-Ade instead of Geno Boost, but then the fight progresses the same way
until it's just Red and Yellow left. Now, Yellow can be inflicted with fear,
but Red cannot, and Red is the far bigger threat here. Inflicting fear is also
very pointless if you are under Yoshi-Ade effects so just go for Red with
physicals. A barrage of physicals will quickly overwhelm him and leave Yellow
alone. Now, Yellow counters physical attacks with Body Slam which is more
powerful than we want to deal with. The solution to this conundrum is Crusher.
It should kill Yellow in five hits. Gogo casting Bowser! Either way, the
Breaker Beam section of the fight is exactly the same for Bowser as it is for
Geno. You, like Geno, are likely to use quite a few Max Mushrooms here, but the
Jinx Belt really proves to be quite the lifesaver. If you are lacking it for
whatever reason, this will be much harder indeed.

Toadstool strategy - Her fight is a slightly harder version of Mallow's fight.
She will be slightly more likely to die early in the fight, and she will have
more trouble when Black or Yellow survive the two Rock Candies since she lacks
Mallow's specials. If you have three Rock Candies, you can feel free to use the
third one in such a case to immediately send the fight to the third stage. Be
sure to only do this if you can survive Breaker Beam; that would be a lame way
to die. If Black is the one alive, you can probably take him down relatively
easily with your physicals. He's very powerful, but durability isn't Black's
specialty. Yellow is a bigger problem. Attacking Yellow results in the very
nasty Body Slam counter. If you have any attacking items at all, use them
against Yellow. Fire Bombs won't hurt Red, but they'll help wear down Yellow.
Ice Bombs are the far better choice as they'll very quickly finish Red while
damaging Yellow a bit more severely than Fire Bombs. When you get to the point
at which you are out of all attacking items and Yellow is still alive, you
should look at what enemies are left. If Red is also alive, kill him first
with physicals. Then heal to full health before touching Yellow, be sure you're
under the effects of a Bracer, and then physically attack. It will be slow and
painful, but you should be able to win. If you have it, Psych Bomb would make
this much less painful. Of course, if you get Red alone from the start, just
smack him around with physicals (after using a Bracer, of course). Once you get
to the Breaker Beam stage, it's as easy as it is for Mallow. Do note that while
I think it's probably possible for a very lucky Mallow to win without the Rock
Candies, I am not so sure for Toadstool. She's just as fragile as Mallow, but
she lacks his superior magical attacking abilities. If you want to try it, be
sure to be at level 18 so you have Psych Bomb. Use Mallow's first option of
going after the casters (Pink and Green) first, and only use Psych Bomb to
attack Yellow after you've killed Black since Spritz Bomb is death for you too.
Good luck; this fight is terrifying!

There you go; the Axem Rangers are fallen! You have just completed one of the
game's most serious boss fights, and you have finished this whole segment of
the game. Take it for you have earned it; the sixth Star Piece is yours!

If you were wondering, yes, it's a glitch that you only get 17 experience
points. You are supposed to get 63 experience points, but the special death
sequences of the Axem Rangers prevents you from getting most of it. Meh, I
guess you're just going to have to fight a bit more in the next dungeon to make
up for it!

Okay, you will find yourself on the world map. Head out and restock on items as
you need them. I would be sure to have 3 Yoshi-Ade before progressing any
farther in the game. You get stuck in Bowser's Keep, and you can't leave until
you finish a series of three boss fights. None of them are particularly nasty,
but if you are woefully under stocked on items, you could force yourself into a
pretty horrible position. Obviously, Geno has absolutely no need of Yoshi-Ade.
Mario, Geno, and Bowser likely need some more Max Mushrooms as well so be sure
to make a stop by Star Hill to pick up some of those.

Also, Toadstool now has access to her ultimate weapon, the Frying Pan. Head on
over the Moleville and talk to the mushroom man in the store. His special shop
has three items you could buy; you want the third one (the other two are not
very useful). This is the Frying Pan, and it's Toadstool's ultimate weapon. It
is a very good weapon, far better than Mallow, Geno, or Bowser's ultimate
weapons. In short, Toadstool can finally do strong damage with her physical
attack. You've only waited the whole game for it.

Toadstool should be able to use this new weapon to beat Jinx now for the Jinx
Belt, but you might want to wait until you are at level 18, a level which gives
a big attack boost, and have her ultimate armor. It's up to you if you want to
try. Mallow shouldn't even think about trying now, and the other three should
be sure to go and stomp Jinx if they haven't already.

Once you are set on items, head over to Nimbus Land and speak with Mallow's
parents. Their infinite wisdom helps you to see that the Star Piece must be the
only place that you haven't been yet which means that it's in Bowser's Keep.
Of course, if you were paying attention during the opening scene of this game,
you would have noticed one of the Star Pieces very clearly fell into Bowser's
Keep. General video game logic indicates that the last thing you need will be
in the place best guarded by the bad guy. You could use the world map to
conclude that it was the next destination. In short, you need to go to Bowser's
Keep. Mallow's parents suggest that he has grown old and mature enough to go
through the true rite of manhood and take the bus there. Seriously, if you
listen to the way they talk about it, that's about how it sounds. Either way,
hop on the bus and be on your way.
