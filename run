This will lead you to a cliff with a
bit of a minigame. You just have to climb shell to shell. Success at all will
open the road to Bean Valley. If you get under twelve seconds, you can win the
Troopa Pin which is a great accessory. Note that if you are doing Mallow or
Toadstool's challenge that you must win the Troopa Pin or else the Axem Rangers
will become quite complicated. You can scale the cliff as often as you like,
and a good time after winning the Troopa Pin will result in you winning five
frog coins. In my opinion, this is the best way to harvest frog coins in the
game; if you want the Scrooge Ring and don't have it, make sure you have 50
frog coins before leaving. Once you are finished here, exit via the obvious
path on the top of the cliff.

This puts you back on the overworld. Go buy the Scrooge Ring now if that's your
plan. If that Kerokerocola harvesting by using Yoshi Cookies on Shy Ranger that
only Geno sounded cool and if you're doing Mario, Mallow, or Toadstool's
challenge, you could go and join in now. The Troopa Pin's 20 speed in
combination with the 5 speed you get from the Work Pants is enough to let all
of them outspeed Shy Ranger. Sadly, Bowser is still just a bit too slow. Poor
Bowser will never be fast enough. Once you're finished with all that, enter the
new area to begin the next dungeon.
