	***BELOME 2
		Fright Bomb / Attack / 88 jumps
		Same fights, do right center left for the belome statues for 100 coins


You just have to fight the Shogun and then go into his whirlpool. Just repeat
this until you end up underground. Shoguns are fairly strong so I would suggest
going all out. Don't be timid about using the higher FP costing Shocker and
Geno Whirl or using Terrorize every fight; it won't hurt you in the long run.

Save once you get down into the cave and then open the chest to find the first
Star. You should be able to take out all the enemies on your way into another
pit. Once down here, avoid all the Geckits and speak to the NPC on the west
edge of the room. He'll offer to sell you a Star for 400 coins. It's a good buy
so do it and then use it to take out all the Geckits in here. Proceed onward to
find yourself in a temple. You may see a floating gas cloud in here. Engage it
if you want to fight an optional boss. Be sure you have the Safety Ring
equipped.

Optional Boss 4 - Mokura

Everyone strategy - With the Safety Ring equipped, you are invincible. Hit him
with your cheapest spell (Jump, Thunderbolt, Geno Beam, Terrorize, Sleepy Time)
to reveal Mokura, and then use physical attacks until you win.

There's also an NPC in here standing on a trampoline. He offers to open a
shortcut to the surface for 100 coins. I would consider it a good purchase, but
you don't need it now either way. Proceed onward, get the 50 coins from the
chest, and then pay them right back to get your fortune told. Depending on
luck, you might or might not have to fight in the room beyond the pipe.
Whatever happens, you will end up in a room with two chests. One contains 150
coins, and the other yields a frog coin. There are also two hidden chests in
here. The first is on top of the visible chest closer to the entrance, and the
second is in a northern corner at the bottom of the stairs. Both contain frog
coins. Proceed onward and get another fortune told. If you get the reading
about hunger, proceed onward. If not, keep trying until you do. It's time for
your next boss fight. Don't forget the Safety Ring! Also, if you're doing
Toadstool's challenge, run back to the last save point and save. Luck abuse is
going to save some time against this boss.

Boss 14 - Belome 2

Mario strategy - Ignore any clones and just focus on Belome. The Safety Ring
protects you from the Mallow clone as well as almost everything Belome can do.
Enjoy having a fast and easy victory.

Mallow strategy - The Safety Ring makes you very invincible during this fight.
Shocker Belome until he falls. Ignore the clones; they are not a threat. This
is laughably easy.

Geno strategy - Open with Geno Boost and then just hit Belome with Geno Beam
until he falls. The Safety Ring protects you from the Mallow and Geno clones
for the most part, and Belome is pretty harmless as long as you have the ring
equipped as well. You can flatten him quickly and easily.

Bowser strategy - Belome (but not the clones) can be inflicted with fear. In
combination with the Safety Ring, this grants you a perfect defense. Likewise,
Belome will not stand up long to Bowser's rampage of physical attacks. Just
ignore the clones and flatten Belome quickly and easily.

Toadstool strategy - Unlike you have come to expect with Toadstool, this fight
is just as easy for her as it is for everyone else. You just need some luck. If
Belome ever makes a Toadstool clone, reset. You can win eventually, but it will
take a very, very long time as you'd have to stall out Toadstool 2's insanely
deep FP pool. What you want to see are Mallow clones. Mallow clones can't do a
thing to you and waste space nicely. Mario clones aren't a big deal either, but
they will force you to heal more often. You could use the Work Pants to speed
up this fight, but Mario clones are very, very dangerous with that low defense.
Once you get an acceptable clone arrangement, just smack Belome with the
Parasol until he falls. Don't waste an Energizer; it doesn't take that long.

After you finish off that arduous boss, proceed to Monstro Town.
